A Web application for creating, managing, and playing music playlists. 

Note that this version is front-end only, written entirely in JavaScript with data saved to the browser's local storage. Many more features will be added in future versions.

What I Learned:
- Model-View-Controller architectural pattern
- Familiarity with Document Object Model
- Event handlers
- Javascript objects and methods
